# Northlit for Codex

Drive [Northlit](https://northlit.ai) — an AI design studio — from Codex.
Explore a brief as a board of design direction mocks, build any direction into a
working HTML prototype, iterate conversationally, generate video, and publish to
a public URL. Everything lands in your Northlit workspace, on real canvases you
can open, edit, and share.

## Install

```
codex plugin marketplace add 3-Elements-Design/northlit-codex
```

Then open `/plugins` inside Codex and install **Northlit**. Sign in when the
OAuth consent opens — your Northlit account's models and credits apply, and you
can disconnect anytime by revoking the connection's access key in
[Settings → API](https://northlit.ai/settings/api).

No account yet? [northlit.ai](https://northlit.ai) — every account starts with
25 free credits.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `northlit-explore` | Start an exploration — a board of divergent design direction mocks from a brief. |
| `northlit-image` | Generate one image on its own editable canvas. |
| `northlit-prototype` | Build a direction into a working HTML prototype and iterate on it. |
| `northlit-video` | Animate an image into a video clip. |
| `northlit-brand` | Read your brand DNA and design on-brand. |
| `northlit-status` | Your plan, remaining credits, and recent work. |

Invoke with `$` (e.g. `$northlit-explore`) or just describe what you want —
skills also trigger implicitly.

## How the server connects

The plugin bundles Northlit's MCP server through
[`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) (the standard
stdio → streamable-HTTP bridge), which runs the OAuth sign-in in your browser.
Requires `npx` on PATH. Prefer Codex's native remote client instead? Skip the
plugin's server and add it directly — the skills work either way:

```
codex mcp add northlit --url https://northlit.ai/api/mcp
codex mcp login northlit
```

## What the server exposes

61 tools, all acting as the signed-in user. Tools marked billable
spend the account's credits — the agent is told the balance up front (`whoami`)
and refusals carry an upgrade path instead of failing silently.

### Start here

- `getting_started` — The full guide: core loop, billing contract, tool reference.
- `whoami` — Your identity, plan, credits, admin flag, and default project.

### Workspace

- `list_projects` — Projects (brands/workspaces) you own or share.
- `list_runs` — Your explorations, newest first.
- `list_moodboards` — Your moodboards, grouped by project.
- `list_brands` — Your brand libraries — id, name, locked state.
- `read_brand` — One brand's full DNA — palette, type, voice, logos.
- `list_design_systems` — Saved design systems — conform explorations via systemIds.

### Explorations & boards

- `create_exploration` — **billable** — Start a run from a brief — a board of direction mocks; returns openUrl + project.
- `check_progress` — Poll a run's pipeline phase and per-direction milestones.
- `generate_mocks` — **billable** — Generate board image mocks for directions without them.
- `add_directions` — **billable** — More TOP-LEVEL directions on an existing board (no parent card).
- `generate_variations` — **billable** — Child variations OF a card — attached under it, its image as edit base.

- `list_directions` — All directions in a run.
- `read_direction` — One direction's full markdown.
- `read_run` — A run's AGENTS.md — the entry point before other reads.
- `read_moodboard` — A run's moodboard as markdown.
- `read_activity` — Reverse-chronological audit log of a run.
- `upscale_image` — **billable** — Upscale a direction's mock to 4K.
- `diff_directions` — Deterministic axis-by-axis diff of two directions.
- `critique_design` — **billable** — Principal-designer critique of a card — 0-100 scores, ranked issues, refine-ready fixPrompt.
- `present_board` — One composed side-by-side grid of a board's direction mocks — the comparison view for decision moments.

### Prototypes

- `build_prototype` — **billable** — Select a direction and build the full HTML prototype.
- `edit_prototype` — **billable** — Natural-language edit that lands as a new saved version.
- `list_prototype_versions` — A prototype's saved version history.
- `revert_prototype` — Make a prior version active (append-only).
- `read_prototype` — A prototype's overview, score, and version history.
- `read_prototype_html` — A prototype's raw rendered HTML.
- `read_chat` — The chat timeline for one direction.
- `publish_prototype` — Deploy a prototype to its public share URL.
- `unpublish_prototype` — Take a published prototype offline.
- `get_build_link` — Tokenized handoff URL any coding agent can fetch.
- `generate_prototype_image` — **billable** — Generate a hosted raster image INTO an existing prototype.
- `crop_mock_region` — Crop a region out of a direction's source mock (hosted URL).
- `view_mock` — See a direction's source mock — renders inline for the user too.

### Imagery

- `list_models` — Model catalog — image (flat 1 credit) + priced video models; ids feed generate_image / generate_video.
- `generate_image` — **billable** — ONE image from a prompt — lands on its own editable canvas; optional model pick.
- `upload_reference_image` — Rehost a local image (data URL) to a usable https reference URL.
- `view_image` — Render any Northlit-hosted image inline in the chat.
- `present_images` — Inline gallery widget of finished images — the display path for ChatGPT.
- `image_to_prompt` — **billable** — Reverse-prompt an image for ui/image/video scopes.

### Video & 3D

- `generate_video` — **billable** — Image-to-video render on the model registry.
- `check_video_status` — Poll a video job; the finished clip is billed on delivery.
- `save_video` — Persist a finished clip to a run — rehosted + indexed.
- `generate_3d` — **billable** — Turn a direction's mock into a 3D GLB model.

### Design knowledge

- `ground_truth_hints` — OCR blocks, layers, and regions extracted from a mock.
- `pixel_perfect_html` — **billable** — Run the render→diff→fix loop until HTML matches a mock.

### Advanced (stateless)

## About this repo

Generated from the Northlit codebase — the tool table and skills derive from
the same manifest that serves the live server, so they can't drift from
reality. Issues welcome here; the plugin is regenerated when the server's
surface changes.
