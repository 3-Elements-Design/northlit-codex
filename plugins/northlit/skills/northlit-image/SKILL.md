description: Generate one image on an editable Northlit canvas
---

Generate a single image with Northlit (no direction board):

(the user's request)

1. Call `generate_image` once with the prompt. It's billed, hosted, and lands on its own editable canvas. For an exact size (an ad slot like 300x250 or 728x90) pass `width` + `height`.
   Making a SET — several ads, a series? Pass the `runId` from the first result on every later call so they all land on ONE canvas.
   An ad under a locked brand? Pass `brandId` and the ad's words in `copy` (headline, subhead, cta) — they're drawn in the brand's real font as a lettering reference, so the type matches the brand.
2. Render the result inline with `view_image` and share the openUrl — the user can open it in the app to edit in Studio, upscale, animate, or share. If your client doesn't render image blocks (ChatGPT doesn't), include the result's `display` markdown line verbatim in your reply instead — ChatGPT renders markdown images.
3. Iterate on the SAME canvas: `generate_variations` makes children of this image. Don't create a new exploration for a tweak.

If the ask is really a design exploration — multiple directions, a brand, a whole page — use the northlit-explore skill instead.
